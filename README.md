# Rapid Manual Testing

A chrome extension designed to automate parts of the manual testing process. Currently filling out forms and clicking buttons are supported. Buttons and inputs are selected by their css selector.

# Local Development

1. If this is your first time building the project locally run `npm i` in the base directory.
2. Next run `npm run dev` in the base directory and parcel will watch for changes to extension.html, content.js, and their respective src directories.
3. Finally, add the extension to Chrome: Click the extension icon (puzzle piece) -> manage extensions -> load upacked and select the base directory.
